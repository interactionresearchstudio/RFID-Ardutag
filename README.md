# RFID-Ardutag

A simple Arduino sketch used to emulate EM4102 RFID tags, used in the current field studies for Naturewatch RFID Bird Freader project.

The intention is to use in situ with the freaders to allow users to set freader credentials on the devices.

## Hardware 

Currently tested using a Naturewatch Freader Coil, combined with an Arduino Uno + N-channel MOSFET (2n7002 etc)

## To do 
* Add byte to output function
* Add UI to allow input of data without needing to edit firmware
